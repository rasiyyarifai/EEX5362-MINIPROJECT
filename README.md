# EEX5362 - Performance Modeling: Daraz E-commerce Fulfillment Simulation Proposal

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This repository contains the initial deliverables for the EEX5362 Performance Modeling mini-project, focusing on analyzing and optimizing the complexity inherent in a large-scale e-commerce logistics system.

The selected system is the **Order Fulfillment Warehouse (FBD Model)** operated by Daraz in Sri Lanka.

The primary goal is to use system modeling to address operational challenges, specifically the high variability in **Latency** (processing time) and bottlenecks that limit **Throughput** during high-demand sales campaigns (e.g., 11.11, Avurudu Sale).
